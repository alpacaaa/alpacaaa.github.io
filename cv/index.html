						Developed and mantained an internal CRM app with a few hundred users.<br>
						Went from a monolitic highly coupled PHP codebase to a separate broadly tested RESTful webservice written in Symfony2.
					</p>

					<p>
						The webservice is now consumed by an Ember.js app which I was in charge of developing completely (code and design wise).

			<h2>About me</h2>

			<p>I never have enough of this stuff, seriously.</p>

			<p>
				Even if I started as a backend developer, I got very much interested in <strong>user experience</strong>, which I strongly believe should be put above anything else.<br>
				My involvement in a project usually spans multiple areas, I enjoy wearing different hats and put myself in uncomfortable situations (we're still talking programming languages, <em>right?</em>).
			</p>

			<p>
				Working in a team is invaluable to me because having different points of views benefit both the project and your personal growth.
			</p>

			<p>
				I've been an enthusiastic <strong>Symphony CMS</strong> developer and fond of its content first approach.<br>
				I've attended the two community meetups held in 2010 and 2011 and get to know some really interesting people.
				I still occasionally use Symphony when freelancing, but it's a bit sad that the project isn't pushing forward anymore.
			</p>

			<p>Overall, being part of that community has been a great experience!</p>

			<h2>Stuff I know</h2>

			<p>
				I'm quite proficient with <strong>Symfony2</strong>, but I consider it bloated and a pain to debug. I know <strong>Javascript</strong> well enough and it's my language of choice nowadays, although I have extensive experience with PHP. Learning <strong>node.js</strong> better is on my todo list, as I've used it only for smallish projects with socket.io and redis.
			</p>

			<p>
				Over the past months, I've been developing with <strong>Ember.js</strong> and enjoying it a lot. A stable release has been around for some time now and it feels pretty solid indeed!
			</p>

			<p>
				My knowledge of <strong>HTML5</strong> and <strong>CSS3</strong> is fairly good, I strive for clean and semantic markup and try hard to make the content look good on any device with responsive design.<br>
				I love <strong>coffeescript</strong> (hated it for a long time though) and <strong>SASS</strong>. Build tools are a truly godsend — I've used <strong>Grunt</strong> and Brunch.
			</p>

			<p>
				A year ago I barely knew what testing was all about. I haven't embraced any methodology so far (BDD looks great) and I still don't believe a 100% test coverage is something worth aiming for. That being said, I write <strong>unit</strong> and <strong>integration tests</strong> more often than not now.
			</p>

			<p>
				I consider a good (and <em>fast</em>) <strong>deployment process</strong> a must because it saved my bacon countless times.
