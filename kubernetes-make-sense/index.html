          <p>Kubernetes is a complex beast. Once you get the hang of some basic features, it can be a nice way of deploying and running software. I've used GKE some years ago and more recently EKS. Despite being &quot;managed&quot; offerings, I found the amount of ad-hoc glue required to keep a cluster going to be just too much.</p>
<p>In principle, Kubernetes is great. I stick to a very productive yet not too complex set of core features (pods / deployments / services). I only deploy stateless services on it â€“ don't like having too many moving parts.</p>
<p>A managed service should let me focus on running my workload. The initial provisioning of a cluster is usually straightforward. It's keeping it alive, getting auto-scaling to work, updating Kubernetes versions that make it a hassle.</p>
<p>I don't want to think about the underlying compute instances. Is the cluster made up of 5 or 12 nodes? Don't really care, as long as it's running and serving traffic.</p>
<p>Ideally, I'd just set a budget and some constraints in terms of instance types and AZ. The vendor takes care of provisioning, auto-scaling and updates.</p>
<p>Stateful workloads may make this more difficult. I'd be very cautious of running a production database on Kubernetes. I rely on RDS, ElastiCache etc. for storage. It seems a common enough pattern.</p>
<p>Maybe there is a stateless subset of Kubernetes that can be offered as a <em>real</em> managed product? Set a budget, get a <code>kubeconfig</code> file and never have to worry about the cluster again. That's when Kubernetes will make sense for me.</p>
<p>Perhaps AWS Fargate is what I'm looking for. Perhaps Azure, DigitalOcean or Linode have implemented something similar. The vendor that figures this out will finally give me a comfortable way of running Kubernetes. Until then, it'll be hard to justify the operational burden.</p>
