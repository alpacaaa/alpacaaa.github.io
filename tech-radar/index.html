        <p>Technologies I like:</p>
<h5>Backend</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Haskell</strong><br>
I worked with Haskell in production. It's great, but it wouldn't be my default choice. I like Haskell and think everyone would benefit from learning it. Writing business logic in Haskell is where it really shines. That's a tiny part of what building a product entails. Still, probably the most important bit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Typescript + Koa</strong><br>
Webapps are boring. Typescript and a light framework like Koa are extremely convenient to scaffold a project. I'd pick these two to build all the boring features, where there's not much to be guessed. Most webapps are not Rocket Science.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monoliths</strong><br>
Microservices sound great on paper and they're probably the only way to go in a large organization. I don't plan to work for big companies anytime soon, so for me it's monoliths all the way from now on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Frontend</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>React + Hooks</strong><br>
Not much to say about this one. I only use Functional components. Hooks are fantastic and have really improved the experience for me. I don't have a use for Redux anymore, thanks to Inertia.js (see below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tailwind CSS</strong><br>
Absolutely brilliant. Takes away all the pain of writing CSS. Super happy with it. I don't think the ugly markup is an issue at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inertia.js</strong><br>
I think Single page apps are the wrong choice 99% of the time. Inertia takes away routing and data fetching from the client, which is fantastic. You keep your routes server side and all the data is passed as props to your components. The outcome is that you use React only as a view layer, writing mostly stateless components.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Watchlist</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Rust</strong><br>
I've been learning Rust for a while. I would pick it to build CLI tools or services where performance is very important. For the type of web apps I build, I haven't found much use for it yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unison</strong><br>
Just insane.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deno</strong><br>
I think it's genius. Probably too early to build apps with it, but I'm sure it'll get big.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AdonisJS</strong><br>
I'm a big fan of Laravel and the sharp focus on getting things done the community has. Laravel + types (w/ Typescript) sounds like an extremely productive combo.</p>
</li>
</ul>
