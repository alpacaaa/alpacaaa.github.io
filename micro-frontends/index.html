      <h1>Scaling Teams with Micro Frontends</h1>
      <p>Monoliths are problematic anywhere in the stack. Splitting up big monolithic
applications into microservices is a hot topic for Backend services, but huge
Frontends exist and have their fair share of problems.</p>
<p>A monolithic Frontend app might be quicker to build and easier to release,
compared to a Backend app. However, things fall apart when multiple teams with
different deadlines and goals end up working on it. Microapps are to the Frontend
what microservices are to the Backend: a way for teams to gain back autonomy and speed of release.</p>
<h3 id="split-apps-by-url">Split apps by url</h3>
<p>In order to split the monolith,
you need to figure out which bits of the application are owned by the different teams.
One rule of thumb is that a single microapp should respond only to requests at a specific
URL prefix. An app handling payments will be concerned with anything under <code>/payment</code> such as
<code>/payment/details</code> and <code>/payment/view/a123bc</code>. Avoid separate top-level URLs
such as <code>/payment-details</code> and <code>/view-payment</code> as they're trickier to route.</p>
<h3 id="a-router-in-front">A router in front</h3>
<p>For Backend services, an Api Gateway receives all traffic coming through and
routes requests to the correct microservices. The same technique can be employed
on the Frontend by using something as simple as an Nginx proxy. There are great
options available for Kubernetes, such as <a href="https://traefik.io/">Traefik</a> and <a href="https://opensource.zalando.com/skipper/">Skipper</a>,
but be sure to understand all the complexity involved with those solutions.</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of <a href="https://samnewman.io/patterns/architectural/bff/">Backends for Frontends</a>, a less painful and perhaps
more romantic approach to routing. You can use the same backend you already have
to route requests, there's no need for Nginx or any fancy proxy in front. It
very much depends on how much traffic you get, but chances are you'll be able
to handle moderate load without issues.</p>
<h3 id="use-url-prefixes">Use URL prefixes</h3>
<p>As said, apps should own a single top-level URL. This is so that the router is
simple to configure and the system easier to reason about. In the Payment app
example above, you wouldn't have to list all the actual URLs the app is able to
handle. That would be a nightmare. A more robust approach is to have the router
route traffic based on URL prefixes. Anything that starts with <code>/payment</code> will be
forwarded to the Payment app.</p>
<p>The addition or removal of a route won't require a reconfiguration of the
router, as long as the prefix stays the same. Because of this, rollbacks are
easier to handle as the router won't be involved. One less thing to worry about.</p>
<p>Changes to the router configuration should be seen as database migrations: they
are backward compatible and don't cause disruption when applied to a running
system. Always allow for a transition period with two routes co-existing (old and
new) instead of dropping the old one and introducing the new one at the same
time. The old route can always be removed later. Negative diff commits are
great —  consider however the slower approach of deprecating a route first and
make sure it is effectively not receiving any traffic (perhaps by a link that
was missed) before removing the relevant code.</p>
<h3 id="fallback-app-and-subdomains">Fallback app and subdomains</h3>
<p>Pick one of your apps to act as a fallback app. Requests that can't be
handled by any other app are going to be served by this <em>catch-all</em> app.
Certainly any unknown request is going to be a <code>404</code>, so why bother?
Chances are there's a marketing department in your company or perhaps an entire team
focused on growth. These folks need to come up with strong URLs for SEO and
might want to experiment and change them often. Updating the router every time is
going to be unfeasible. A better option is to have the marketing site being the
catch-all app, so that the router doesn't have to know any of the actual routes.</p>
<p>If you can't roll out a router, consider using a subdomain. There are many
companies that serve traffic for logged in users at <code>app.company.com</code> while
anonymous traffic goes through <code>www.company.com</code>. You can also do the
reverse with <code>about.company.com</code> being the <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">main website</a>. Although the marketing
department will hate you for that.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Going with microapps might look like an architectural defeat. Components in some
flavour (be it React components, web components or what have you) should be enough
to scale an application. Even so, a large application will still be challenging
to work on as it grows in size. When struggling with deploy times, consistently
broken builds and slow release cycles, microapps could be the cure. As with
microservices, you have to be careful. Having your users download a 3mb bundle
for each different page is not what I'm advocating for. Teams need to agree on a
single framework and be mindful of user experience. Bundle splitting plays a big
role here — users should download React only once.</p>
<p>There's one thing I absolutely love about microapps: static pages. It seems like
everything nowadays has to be a Single Page Application, otherwise you're missing
out. I think SPAs are great for highly interactive pages. Go and build those
pages as SPAs, but anything else can be statically generated or even server rendered
(a tiny node/ruby/python app can go a long way). As most things in technology,
reach for the simplest abstraction first and see if you can solve the problem
with that. Microapps allow teams to work at different abstraction levels. When
you need the big hammer (SPAs) then you can and should go for it. But when you
realize a large monolithic React app is no fun to work on, then consider splitting
it up into micro frontend applications.</p>
