        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why this book?</h3>
        <p>
          This is the book I wish I had when learning Haskell. There are a lot
          of great books out there that
          <strong>teach you the language</strong> – but not how to actually
          <strong>build applications with it</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I read many Haskell books. They're great to learn about types,
          currying, type classes, Functors, Applicatives, Monads… but then what?
          I felt lost. Many times I just wanted to give up because I couldn't
          see how I should apply everything that I have learned in a
          <em>practical</em> way.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's hard to tell what's considered <strong>best practice</strong> in
          the Haskell world. And that makes it difficult to get proficient with
          the language. That's why this book focuses on
          <strong>Simple Haskell</strong>, a subset of the language that I find
          strikes the right balance between features and ease of use.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">A real-world project</h3>
        <p>
          In this book, we'll build a Continuous Integration Server. Why such a
          project? I wanted something serious enough that could pose some
          <strong>real challenges</strong> while developing it. No point
          implementing yet another blog or todo-list or similar toy applications
          – you're not going to learn much from those.
        </p>
        <p>
          A CI Server is interesting for a number of reasons. The domain isn't
          trivial which means we'll have to put some thought into
          <strong>coming up with the right model</strong>. The application will
          have to work with external systems such as Docker containers and
          Github webhooks so there's plenty of lessons to learn from there.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          Here's a brief list of features that <strong>Quad CI</strong> (our
          very own CI server!) will support:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc ml-12 mb-6">
          <li>sandboxed builds in Docker containers</li>
          <li>
            multi-node architecture with agents picking up jobs to work on
          </li>
          <li>http api to interact with the frontend and other nodes</li>
          <li>support for triggering builds with github webhooks</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We'll get to build all that, <em>from scratch!</em>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Who is this book for?</h3>
        <p>
          This book won't teach you Haskell. I assume you have some
          understanding of the language, can solve basic exercises and know what
          <code>IO</code> actions are.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead, this book will teach you <strong>how to think</strong> about
          problems in a functional language. We won't get things right the first
          time, there's going to be <strong>a lot of refactoring</strong>. But
          that's why Haskell is so good right? Many people praise Haskell for
          its refactoring capabilities, but very few show
          <em>precisely</em> what refactoring Haskell code feels like. That's
          because you need a real project to experience that – you'll see many
          examples of it throughout the book.
        </p>

        <p>
          This book is for people that want to move
          <strong>from theory to practice</strong>. There's plenty of material
          on learning the language but very little has been written on
          architecting applications and the thought process behind it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even if you don't plan on using Haskell in your day job, most of the
          lessons in this book will apply to other languages as well. Embracing
          Functional Programming will make you a better programmer, no matter
          the technology.

          Hi, my name is Marco. After many years working with traditional
          programming languages, I decided I had enough of runtime errors.
          That's when I started my journey into Functional Programming. I first
          got into Elm and then, with some more effort, into Haskell. This
          experience completely changed the way I look at Software development –
          it really was a better way to build applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          I hope you'll enjoy this book, I'm definitely having a lot of fun
          writing it!
